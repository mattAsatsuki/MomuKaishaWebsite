    We're a small research and development group located in the Pacific Northwest dedicated designing and creating. First conceptualized in 2024 as a multipurpose manufacturing company, over the course of nearly a year MOMU has changed and diversified it's services to encompass many more valuable focuses. Notably, MOMU has gone beyond that of creating physical works and extended into web design and data management for low-traffic and small-scale deployments.

    The name MOMU stems from two languages—Japanese and Tagalog—for it's association with ghosts. In Japanese, 蟐 (モム, <em>momu</em>) is simply a character (or kanji) that has no known meaning (otherwise known as a <em>ghost character</em>) and makes up MOMU's logo. In Tagalog, <em>mumu</em> or <em>momo</em> mean <em>ghost</em>, which applies to the phonetic Latin spelling of MOMU. The affiliation with ghosts in MOMU's branding philosophy comes down to one key aspect of the group: <b>putting the idea before the brand</b><!--, as one of MOMU's core beliefs is to ensure that a name does not interfere with the experience-->.
